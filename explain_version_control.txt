Version control means that the history of changes within software code, what was changed, who changed it, and when it happened, is recorded.
There are many benefits to version control, but one of the main benefits is that if a change causes a bug or break in the program,
the program can be rolled back to a previous version to get the software working while developers look over the code and see what 
caused the break. I use version control a lot at work. Recently a new update was released at work that would create a new highly
demanded account type. However, this update crashed our site, and caused the other account roles to stop functioning correctly.
Version control was used to roll back that update so that our customers could continue using the site while developers reviewed
the code to find out what was going on. A developer can work on multiple files within a program at once, but only push the files 
that are ready to be merged into the main branch by staging the files using "git add <file name>". Using the exact file name allows 
the developer to control which files are added to the next commit, and which ones hang back to continue development.
